            <h2>What is Cancer Biology?</h2>
            <p>
                Cancer is a broad term for diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. 
                This can happen when errors or mutations occur in cells. 
                Cancer biology is the study of the uncontrolled growth of cells and how it leads to the development of cancer.

            <h2>The Importance of Research</h2>
            <p>There are over 100 different types of cancer. Some of the most common types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lung Cancer</li>
                <li>Breast Cancer</li>
                <li>Prostate Cancer</li>
                <li>Colorectal Cancer</li>
                <li>Leukemia (Blood Cancer)</li>
                <li>Melanoma (Skin Cancer)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To understand how cancer develops and progresses, cancer biologists need to investigate the biological differences between normal and cancer cells.  
                The research data collected from this can be used to find new possible treatment strategies and ways to further treat cancer. </p>

            <h2>Prevention and Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>
                According to research certain lifestyle and environmental factors can increase the risk of developing cancer. Common strategies for prevention include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a healthy diet and weight.</li>
                <li>Avoiding tobacco use.</li>
                <li>Limiting alcohol consumption.</li>
                <li>Protecting skin from excessive sun exposure.</li>
                <li>Getting vaccinated against cancer-causing viruses (e.g., HPV, Hepatitis B).</li>
                <li>Engaging in regular physical activity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cancer biology also helps identify Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>
                The treatment of cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease. Common treatment options include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Removal of the tumor and surrounding tissue.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> Use of high-energy particles to kill cancer cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Use of drugs to kill rapidly dividing cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Boosting the immune system to fight cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Drugs that specifically target cancer cells without affecting normal cells.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
